In this work, we introduce Semantic-SAM, a universal image segmentation model to enable segment and recognize anything at any desired granularity. 
Our model offers the following atributes from instance to part level:
* Semantic Awareness
* Granularity Abundance

## Interactive Multi-Granularity Segmentation

## Multi-Granularity Image Editing
